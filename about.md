![Kyle Schaeffer](/assets/img/Kyle-Beard-Headshot.jpg){:.img-right.img-thumb}I build apps and occasionally grow a beard. I like music, good books, and spending time in the great outdoors with my family.

I have been designing and building software for nearly two decades. I find this type of development to be an ideal medium in which elements of both art and technology can collide. These disparate disciplines allow me to practice both sides of my brain, to create and implement ideas in a rapidly changing environment that reinvents itself every few years.

It’s an exciting field to work in. While I will always have fantastical dreams of becoming a novelist or musician (don’t we all?), the reality of the interim has proved to suit me just fine. App design and development has found a comfortable place in my professional life, and I dare say that I even enjoy it.

In 2014, my wife and I started a company called [Spiritous](https://spirito.us/). Looking for someone to design and build your next digital project? [Get in touch.](https://spirito.us/contact/)
