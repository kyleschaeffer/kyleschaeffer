I like music, good books, and spending time in the great outdoors with my lovely wife, Erika.

I have been designing and building websites for over a decade.  The web is an ideal medium in which elements of both art and technology can collide.  These disparate disciplines allow me to practice both sides of my brain, to create and implement ideas in a rapidly changing environment that reinvents itself every few years.

It&#8217;s an exciting field to work in.  While I will always have fantastical dreams of becoming a novelist or musician (don&#8217;t we all?), the reality of the interim has proved to suit me just fine. Web design has found a comfortable place in my professional life, and I dare say that I even enjoy it.
