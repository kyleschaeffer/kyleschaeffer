On January 23-26, 2012, I’ll be instructing a class that focuses on the more advanced strategies behind applying style and branding to a SharePoint 2010 website. This isn’t your average SharePoint training class: we’ll cover topics like improving the SharePoint user experience, creative design for the SharePoint platform, and implementation strategy for making your creative designs come to life. Over four days, we’ll learn how to bend the rules in SharePoint to make it a truly limitless platform for customization.

I’ve been working with SharePoint for a long time now, and going beyond the basics is a challenging barrier to overcome. Many of the free online resources pertaining to SharePoint customization (and many of the paid ones) only cover the most simple of changes that you can make to your design. Learning how to implement a more comprehensive design is difficult, to say the least. In this new class, we are taking these advanced techniques head-on, and we’ll show you how to implement awesome changes like responsive layouts, comprehensive themes, and amazing enhancements using jQuery.

At least some experience with SharePoint customization, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are highly recommended: we’ll be diving head-on into the world of SharePoint design. For more information, you can read all about the upcoming class here:

## SharePoint Saturday: Virginia Beach

Can’t make it to the class in January? You’ll also see me speaking at the free SharePoint Saturday event at Virginia Beach on January 7, 2012.  I’ll be doing two sessions at this event: “SharePoint Goes Mobile” and “HTML5 & CSS3: What about SharePoint?”
