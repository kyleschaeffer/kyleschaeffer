I'm excited to announce yet another new online training course that I’ve been working on over the past several months. In [Web Interaction for Everyone](https://webinteract.io/), I teach the art of front-end development. I truly believe that the best teacher is experience. As such, in the course we demonstrate building interactive web components like dropdown menus, tabs, accordions, sliders, and more. I had a lot of fun creating and recording the course, and I’m really happy with the way it turned out.

### What You’ll Learn

- How to build awesome web interactions and components like toggles, tabs, accordions, dropdown menus, modal dialogs, sortables, sliders, and more
- Working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Document Object Model (DOM)
- JavaScript event listeners, component classes, and DOM manipulation/traversal
- Drag and drop, touch swipe gestures, and working with asynchronous content
- Working with reactive frameworks like [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- Interaction design, CSS, SCSS, transitions, and animations
- Accessibility best practices such as keyboard support, focus trapping, ARIA attributes, screen reader support, and ARIA live content
- ...and so much more

My original plan for the course was actually much smaller in scope. The plan was to create a course that was perhaps 8-12 lessons spread across ~6-8 hours of instruction. It turned out to be 34 lessons and more than 14 hours of video. My propensity for tangents, and my planned-but-not-too-planned teaching style led to this longer course length, and I’m glad it did. When it was said and done, this just seemed like the right content for the curriculum.

I think this is a great opportunity to learn modern web technology for developers both new and experienced. It’s fast, focused, fun, and at times even a bit silly. The components we build in the course are just plain awesome, and we spend a lot of time working on things like CSS animation, transitions, and nitty-gritty details like ARIA accessibility, keyboard support, and extensibility.
