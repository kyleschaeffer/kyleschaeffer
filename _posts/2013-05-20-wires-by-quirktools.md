My lack of posts as of late is largely due to my pet project, [QuirkTools](https://quirktools.com). It’s been much more successful than I had ever anticipated, and I’m excited to be working on some exciting new features that will be released in the coming days and weeks. If you’ve never seen QuirkTools, check out this video showcasing the flagship web app, Wires.
