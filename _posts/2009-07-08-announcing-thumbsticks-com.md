After many months of diligent design, testing, and development, I have finally reached the first major release of my latest project, [ThumbSticks.com](http://thumbsticks.com). You may have seen the design for this site on my [portfolio](/portfolio) page for quite some time now. This creative design has finally become a reality!

I’ve been working on the project in my spare time, so progress has been slow, but I am very pleased with the results. The site is still in an early stage of development, but the core features and functionality are all there. The design is based on a very flexible CSS grid system, which has worked out quite well. I think I might post my template for this grid system here on my blog some time soon; hopefully it can be of some use to you as it was to me. If you or anyone you know has even a remote interest in video games, please feel free to visit [ThumbSticks.com](http://thumbsticks.com). Membership is free, and there are currently no advertisements on the site at all; it’s all about entertainment and collaboration! You can use the “Report a Problem” feature at the bottom of every page to submit any feedback that you may have.
