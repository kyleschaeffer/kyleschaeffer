I had the pleasure of doing a great workshop with [Paul Swider](http://paulswider.com) yesterday at [SPTechCon](http://www.sptechcon.com/boston2012/). In this end-to-end workshop, we discussed strategy, processes, and implementation techniques for building a public-facing SharePoint publishing site. Paul had some great insight on architecture and strategy, while I detailed the journey from idea to Photoshop to SharePoint, with a few tips and tricks along the way. The end result was a fictitious digital bakery, built on the able shoulders of SharePoint 2010.

You can read all about the workshop, view our slides, and even download the source code for the final master page in all its imaginary glory [on Paul’s blog post, here](http://paulswider.com/2012/07/22/building-a-web-site-with-sharepoint/).
