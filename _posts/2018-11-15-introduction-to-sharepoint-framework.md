I’m excited to announce a new online class I’ve been working on and recording over the past several months. It’s called **Introduction to SharePoint Framework**, and I find it to be a refreshingly enjoyable online training course taking you from zero to expert in all things SPFx.

This is a great way to learn modern SharePoint development, and it represents the first of many educational training products that I’ll be working on throughout the next several months. Sign up for a student account or a free trial to begin at [sharepointfx.io](https://sharepointfx.io/).
