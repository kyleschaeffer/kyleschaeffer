I’ve totally revamped my weekend project, [ThumbSticks.com](http://thumbsticks.com). An entirely new visual presentation accompanies what I hope to be the final version of my ambitious new website. I’m still working on adding box art and other media to the thousands of products you can find on the site, but it’s come quite a long way since [last year when I officially launched the initial beta](/announcing-thumbsticks-com).

I’ll be giving a quick presentation of this project at an upcoming event, [Refresh Winchester](http://www.refreshwinchester.org/), next Thursday, April 1. If you’re in the area, be sure to stop by and see how I approached this project from concept to complete. Mostly, you’ll get to hear about all the stupid mistakes I made and how in subsequent revisions, I learned from those mistakes in my journey to SEO success. I’m happy to see that I’ve made it to page one for my targeted keywords, “[video game rankings](http://www.google.com/search?q=video+game+rankings),” which I’m extremely excited about. I only recently delved into the depths of what makes a site SEO-friendly, so seeing my newly learned techniques and tweaks come to fruition has been an extremely rewarding experience for me.

Take a look, let me know what you think, and even sign up for an account if you’re so inclined!
