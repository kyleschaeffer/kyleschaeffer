I&#8217;ve totally revamped my weekend project, [ThumbSticks.com](http://thumbsticks.com). An entirely new visual presentation accompanies what I hope to be the final version of my ambitious new website. I&#8217;m still working on adding box art and other media to the thousands of products you can find on the site, but it&#8217;s come quite a long way since [last year when I officially launched the initial beta](http://www.kyleschaeffer.com/personal/announcing-thumbsticks-com/).<!--more-->

I&#8217;ll be giving a quick presentation of this project at an upcoming event, [Refresh Winchester](http://www.refreshwinchester.org/), next Thursday, April 1. If you&#8217;re in the area, be sure to stop by and see how I approached this project from concept to complete. Mostly, you&#8217;ll get to hear about all the stupid mistakes I made and how in subsequent revisions, I learned from those mistakes in my journey to SEO success. I&#8217;m happy to see that I&#8217;ve made it to page one for my targeted keywords, &#8220;[video game rankings](http://www.google.com/search?q=video+game+rankings),&#8221; which I&#8217;m extremely excited about. I only recently delved into the depths of what makes a site SEO-friendly, so seeing my newly learned techniques and tweaks come to fruition has been an extremely rewarding experience for me.

Take a look, let me know what you think, and even sign up for an account if you&#8217;re so inclined!
