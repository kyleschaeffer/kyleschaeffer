I&#8217;ve done some crazy things to make SharePoint work like I want it to. One of the things that I&#8217;ve done in the past is write some insanely complex XSLT functions to format dates in SharePoint 2007 item styles. SharePoint 2007 offered a very useful [`FormatDate` feature](http://www.novolocus.com/2010/04/12/date-formats-in-xsl-with-ddwrt/) of the DDWRT XSL library, but the formatting customization was limited to picking a prefab format, which didn&#8217;t always gel with what you or your client wanted to see.<!--more--> To get some custom date formats, I wrote crazy XSLT functions that literally had 

`<xsl:if>` statements that checked a substring of the SharePoint date for every month of the year (seriously). Not the ideal solution, but it worked; sometimes, SharePoint gives you lemons and you have to make&hellip;well, you know.

## 2010, How Refreshing!

I didn&#8217;t realize it at first (mostly because Microsoft documentation on this stuff can be very hard to find), but SharePoint 2010 seems to support a new DDWRT function that I&#8217;ve found to be very useful. You can still use `FormatDate`, but you now have a new function called `FormatDateTime` at your designer&#8217;s disposal. Here&#8217;s how it works.

  1. Open the file that contains all the item styles for your SharePoint 2010 site (**/Style Library/XSL Style Sheets/ItemStyle.xsl**).
  2. Near the top of this file, you should see an element called `<xsl:stylesheet>`. Add a new attribute to this element (if it&#8217;s not already there) like so: 
    <pre>xmlns:ddwrt="http://schemas.microsoft.com/WebParts/v2/DataView/runtime"</pre>

  3. Now, in an item style, you can use the new function like so: 
    <pre>&lt;xsl:value-of select="ddwrt:FormatDateTime(<strong>@Created</strong>, 1033, <strong>'MMMM d, yyyy'</strong>)" /&gt;</pre>

Simply substitute `@Created` for the date/time column of your choice. You can use a lot of different values for the date (in our example above, the date is output in `MMMM d, yyyy` format, which appears like **April 12, 2011** within an item style. Refer to [Microsoft&#8217;s MSDN article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8kb3ddd4(v=vs.95).aspx) for a list of all the date variations that you can use â€“ it&#8217;s highly flexible, and allows you to output things like 12-hour time formats or even time zone information (something that was lacking in the old `FormatDate` function).

## More Item Style Resources

While we&#8217;re on the topic of SharePoint 2010 item styles, I&#8217;ve run into a few snags in this new product, and you might just benefit from my experience while you&#8217;re rolling your own custom item styles. Most importantly, you might notice that after creating a new custom item style and applying it to a page, it works splendidly _until_ you open that page up and view it as an anonymous user. Everything is checked in, published, and soon you&#8217;ll be pulling your hair out trying to figure out why anonymous users are getting a mysterious error message on your fancy new item styles.

You can fix this strange anonymous-users-only error in one of two ways:

  1. Some item styles start out with XSL variables that have names like `SafeImageUrl` or `DisplayTitle`. If you aren&#8217;t using these variables in your item style, simply delete these variables altogether! The presence of these variables can _sometimes_ cause the anonymous error message to appear, and removing them is often all that is needed to resolve your issues.
  2. Waldek Mastykarz found that adding `DocumentIconImageUrl` and `OnClickForWebRendering` to the `CommonViewFields` property of the web part also clears up any issues you might have with this error appearing for anonymous users. You can [read Waldek&#8217;s post here](http://blog.mastykarz.nl/inconvenient-sharepoint-2010-content-query-web-part-anonymous-access/) for more information. Basically, you need to _export_ the web part, open it up in a text editor, and find the line that says `CommonViewFields`, and change this line to what you see in Waldek&#8217;s post. Once that&#8217;s done, simply import the web part back into the page (delete the old one), and you should be all set.

As always, if you&#8217;re looking to get started creating item styles in SharePoint 2010, [Heather Solomon&#8217;s custom item styles blog post](http://www.heathersolomon.com/blog/articles/CustomItemStyle.aspx) is still relevant to everything you&#8217;ll need to do in SharePoint 2010.
