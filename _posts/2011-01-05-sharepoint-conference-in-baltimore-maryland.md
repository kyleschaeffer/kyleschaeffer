I&#8217;m very excited to be a part of the upcoming SharePoint .ORG Conference that will be held in Baltimore this year.  If you have even a small amount of interest in SharePoint or SharePoint design, you&#8217;ll love the line-up.  I&#8217;ve attended and have spoken at numerous conferences and events around the country, but this is the first SharePoint conference I&#8217;ve seen with a dedicated &#8220;design&#8221; track.  I&#8217;m very excited to have the opportunity to speak at a few of the design sessions, and I look forward to seeing any readers at the conference.<!--more-->

The keynote speaker is **Kristina Halvorson**.  I&#8217;ve seen Kristina speak at two separate events before, and both times I have entered her sessions with my customary eye of scrutiny, and have left with unexpected revelations about web content.  She&#8217;s always a pleasure to listen to, and I&#8217;m excited to have her at our conference this year.

Check out the full line up at at [SharePointConference.org](http://www.sharepointconference.org).  Highlights from the design track include:

  * Designing for SharePoint: Avoid the Pitfalls
  * 10 Ways to Make SharePoint NOT Look Like SharePoint
  * Best Practices: Usability and Accessibity
  * Designing for Mobile
  * Enhance SharePoint 2010 with Amazing JQuery Controls
  * The (Near) Future of the Web: HTML5 and CSS3
  * Silverlight for SharePoint
  * Lightning Sessions: Design (three 20 minute sessions on design topics with five minute breaks)

I hope to see you there!
