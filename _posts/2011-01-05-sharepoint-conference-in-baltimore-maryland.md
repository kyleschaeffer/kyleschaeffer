I’m very excited to be a part of the upcoming SharePoint .ORG Conference that will be held in Baltimore this year.  If you have even a small amount of interest in SharePoint or SharePoint design, you’ll love the line-up.  I’ve attended and have spoken at numerous conferences and events around the country, but this is the first SharePoint conference I’ve seen with a dedicated “design” track.  I’m very excited to have the opportunity to speak at a few of the design sessions, and I look forward to seeing any readers at the conference.

The keynote speaker is **Kristina Halvorson**.  I’ve seen Kristina speak at two separate events before, and both times I have entered her sessions with my customary eye of scrutiny, and have left with unexpected revelations about web content.  She’s always a pleasure to listen to, and I’m excited to have her at our conference this year.

Check out the full line up at at [SharePointConference.org](http://www.sharepointconference.org).  Highlights from the design track include:

* Designing for SharePoint: Avoid the Pitfalls
* 10 Ways to Make SharePoint NOT Look Like SharePoint
* Best Practices: Usability and Accessibity
* Designing for Mobile
* Enhance SharePoint 2010 with Amazing JQuery Controls
* The (Near) Future of the Web: HTML5 and CSS3
* Silverlight for SharePoint
* Lightning Sessions: Design (three 20 minute sessions on design topics with five minute breaks)

I hope to see you there!
