Are you in the Winchester area? I&#8217;ll be speaking at [Refresh Winchester](http://www.refreshwinchester.org/2010/03/lessons-learned-a-lamp-story/) tonight, detailing my painstaking journey throughout the development of my personal pet project, [ThumbSticks.com](http://thumbsticks.com). It&#8217;s been a long road, and there have been many bumps along the way. I&#8217;ll share what worked, what didn&#8217;t, and I&#8217;ll also share a few invaluable assets I discovered along the way. If you&#8217;re nearby, be sure to check it out tonight at 6:30pm in downtown Winchester.
