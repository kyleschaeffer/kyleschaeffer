Are you in the Winchester area? I’ll be speaking at [Refresh Winchester](http://www.refreshwinchester.org/2010/03/lessons-learned-a-lamp-story/) tonight, detailing my painstaking journey throughout the development of my personal pet project, [ThumbSticks.com](http://thumbsticks.com). It’s been a long road, and there have been many bumps along the way. I’ll share what worked, what didn’t, and I’ll also share a few invaluable assets I discovered along the way. If you’re nearby, be sure to check it out tonight at 6:30pm in downtown Winchester.
