I had the pleasure of speaking at [SharePoint Saturday Virginia Beach](http://www.sharepointsaturday.org/virginiabeach/) this weekend. Thanks for all who attended; I had a great time speaking on some exciting new topics, and sharing my passion for design in SharePoint.<!--more--> For those of you who were at the seminar, and also for those who might be interested, I wanted to share my presentations on my two sessions: 

**HTML5 & CSS3: What About SharePoint?** and **SharePoint Goes Mobile**. You can view or download the presentations in PDF format here:
