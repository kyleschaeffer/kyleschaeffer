I know it’s been a long time since my last post, but things have been busy! I’m at [An Event Apart](http://www.aneventapart.com) this week, which is a conference for UI designers such as myself. I’ll be making a few posts that have been “in the making” for quite a while now in the coming weeks, so look forward to seeing some new design tips and tricks in the days to come.
