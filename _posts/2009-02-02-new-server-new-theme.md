In the process of moving my blog to a new web server, I decided to take this opportunity to create a new theme for the site. The theme changes depending on what time of day or time of the year that you visit, so check back often! I&#8217;ll continue to add little customizations for holidays, special occasions, etc. (what a wonderful use of my time it is to create little meaningless PNG images). Let me know what you think.
