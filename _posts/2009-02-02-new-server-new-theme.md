In the process of moving my blog to a new web server, I decided to take this opportunity to create a new theme for the site. The theme changes depending on what time of day or time of the year that you visit, so check back often! I’ll continue to add little customizations for holidays, special occasions, etc. (what a wonderful use of my time it is to create little meaningless PNG images). Let me know what you think.
