I am pleased to announce the launch of my latest project, [ThePeev.com](http://thepeev.com/). The Peev is a quick and dirty WordPress site designed for the sole purpose of serving as my personal artistic outlet. I’m posting doodles and sketches regarding all the things in life that may or may not bother you. I had a lot of fun creating the site, which came together nicely from concept to complete in less than eight hours of work. What’s your pet peeve? Visit [ThePeev.com](http://thepeev.com/) and let me know.
