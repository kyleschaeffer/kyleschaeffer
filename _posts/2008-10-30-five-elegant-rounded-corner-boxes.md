I wanted to really take the concept of my “[Karate Corners](/karate-corners-easy-rounded-corners-xhtml-no-script)” design to new levels, so I created this simple demo to show you how visual elegance can work in tandem with technical simplicity.

Seeing is believing, so without further adieu&hellip;
