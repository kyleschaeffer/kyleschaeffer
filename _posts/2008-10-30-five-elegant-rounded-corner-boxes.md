I wanted to really take the concept of my &#8220;[Karate Corners](http://www.kyleschaeffer.com/?p=31)&#8221; design to new levels, so I created this simple demo to show you how visual elegance can work in tandem with technical simplicity.<!--more-->

Seeing is believing, so without further adieu&#8230;
