I enjoy teaching others about my trade. Here, you’ll find a collection of educational resources and online classes I have created.

## [Web Interaction for Everyone](https://webinteract.io/)

Learn the art of front-end development in no time. Upon completion, you’ll have built an entire library of common web interaction components like toggles, tabs, accordions, sliders, dropdown menus, sortables, and more. Get started at for free at [webinteract.io](https://webinteract.io/).

## [Introduction to SharePoint Framework](https://sharepointfx.io/)

Learn TypeScript, React, and the SharePoint Framework in one awesome course. In each lesson, we work on building several SharePoint applications including web parts, extensions, and a pretty awesome dashboard visualization web part.
